#### Basic Logging

Basic logging is what you will use most of the time.  You can write out trace statements, timings and program flow using a variety of logging commands at different trace levels.  See the following documentation:
[Basic Logging](diags-bilge-basiclogging.md)


### Transient Data

Occasionally you need data that transitions very quickly - there is a special implementation of transient data in Bilge which can be represented in flimflam.  It is not a common scenario - see [Using Transient Data](diags-bilge-transientLogging.md)

#### Actions
Actions are a specific use case - there are times when you need to know whether the code has done something, either for the point of view of testing or to be sure features are working as expected.
