<h2>Using The Versioning In Scripts - e.g. Powershell</h2>
<p>Sometimes you will want to use the version number that is generated in a script, rather than replace in a predefined file.  There are several output methods
that are used to do this.</p>
<h3>Walkthrough - Using Versioning in a Docker Tag</h3>
<p>This assumes that you have already created a version store and are using it to version elements such as the code.  For simplicity none of that will be included in this guide and it will also be assumed that the version store will be incremented elsewhere ( for example during the code build process). Therefore this walkthrough shows how to tag a docker image with the same version number that was just applied to the code.</p>
<p>Take this powershell script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-dockerfile">docker build -t papi-api .
docker tag papi-api itseyreg.azurecr.io/papi-api:latest
</code></pre>
<p>One way to tag the version is by doing a replacement on the file and treating it as a text file like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-dockerfile">docker tag papi-api itseyreg.azurecr.io/papi-api:XXX-VERSION-XXX
</code></pre>
<p>This works but requires that you update your script file each time, and that is not the most convenient if running by hand, therefore we will look at an alternative approach that can be run inline to the file to take the correct version.</p>
<pre><code class="language-dos">pliskytool.exe -Command=Passive -VersionSource=C:\temp\aversion.vstore -O=File
$verval = Get-Content plisky-version.txt
docker tag papi-api itseyreg.azurecr.io/papi-api:$verval
</code></pre>
<p>The passive mode of operation does no increment but simply opens the versioning store and retrieves the version number.  The -O=file command then writes that to a file.  This can then be read by your own utilities or in this case the Get-Content command in powershell.</p>
<p>Once the value is in a variable in powershell it can be used as normal.</p>
