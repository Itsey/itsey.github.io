<h4 id="mollycoddle-rules">Mollycoddle Rules</h4>
<p>Mollycoddle rules are highly configurable but there are a default set that ship.  It is expected that not all of these will match your coding style but then you can change the configuration to suit your own structure.</p>
<p>Note that there are gaps between the numbers to allow for other to be specified, for example if your chosen programming lanugage is py and not c# then creating an alternative ruleset to forbid other filetypes should be simple and can fit in the same rule gap if you wish.</p>

<p>Only preferred packages may be used.<br />
Alternatives are added to the band list.<br />
Packages which fail security scannign are added to the band list.</p>
