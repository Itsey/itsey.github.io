<blockquote>
<p>For when you just cant let the babbers code on their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MollyCoddle is a directory and file linting solution for source control projects designed to check the structure of the source repository rather than the code itself.  It is NOT a code linting solution there are plenty of those out there already.</p>
<h4 id="using-mollycoddle">Using Mollycoddle</h4>
<p>Execute MollyCoddle from the command line, passing a parameter of the path to scan and a -masterRoot parameter for using master files.</p>
