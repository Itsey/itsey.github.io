## Roadmap

Bilge has gone on a long and winding journey but remains a constant way of delivering trace therefore will be expanded in the future.  Along the way there are now many more options for writing and working with trace but none yet share the same ideals.

### Flim Flam 2

Flim Flam 2 - an enhancement to flimflam was conceived due to the age of the original flim flam code and the fact that the application is too complex to support propery.  Intially a web version was developed but this proved too complex and therefore flew in the face of the ideal of enabling the developer.  Therefore a new client app will be created.

Microsoft changed is UI recommendations and approach so the next stage will be to redevelop this in Maui
