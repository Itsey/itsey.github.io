<h3 id="analyzing-performance-walk-through">Analyzing Performance  - Walk through</h3>
<p>In this example we use the trace in an application to determine the performance issues surrounding a page render and the improvement that the changes make.  Bilge performance is quick and dirty, it is not a substitute for a performance analysis tool but quite often it is enough to get you to the point where detailed performance analysis can support code changes.</p>
<p>From the initial view we can see that the page renders and then a large number of retrievals for tags are performed, there are two things that stand out from the trace - #1 ActualGetTagsForTargetId is hit repeatedly and #2 the full 30 images are queried and then only 10 are returned.  As the number of images grows this will perform worse and worse.</p>
<p>First thing is add some timing code</p>
<pre><code>public ActionResult Gallery(string Id = null) {
    b.Info.Flow($&quot;ID: {Id}&quot;);
    b.Verbose.TimeStart(&quot;GalleryController&quot;, timerCategoryName: &quot;GalleryEndToEnd&quot;);
    // Rest of the controller code goes here
    b.Verbose.TimeStop(&quot;GalleryController&quot;, timerCategoryName: &quot;GalleryEndToEnd&quot;);
    return View(vm);
}

</code></pre>
<p>Time starts and stops must have identical titles to link up correctly and this will then show in Flimflam as a display of the timings. We can already see that the majority of the time is spent in the GetGallery method.</p>
