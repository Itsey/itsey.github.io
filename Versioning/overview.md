## Versioning Overview

To get up and running really quickly but without much information there is the [Quick Start](quickstart.md) guide.  The overview provides more detailed information and the reference provides reference information for when you are using the versioning tool.

### Command Line Tool

Versioning can be referenced from the assembly in your own code or through the command line tool.  The command line tool is designed to allow you to automate versioning tasks and be included in pipelines and DevOps automations.  

The command line tool is pliskytool.exe and is used for most operations.  See the [Command Line Reference](commandline.md) for full syntax and information.
